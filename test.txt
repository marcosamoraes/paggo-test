Take-Home Case Outline

Objective:
Design and implement a solution that allows users to upload an invoice image to a webpage, automatically extract text from the image using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and display a structured summary of the extracted data to the user.

Requirements:

System Design Document:
● Describe the architecture of the solution, including the frontend, backend, cloud
resources, and any external services or APIs

● Include a diagram illustrating the components and their interactions.

● Detail the AWS resources to be used (e.g., Lambda, RDS, etc)

Database Modeling:
● Design a high-level model of the database using PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM

Frontend:
● Develop a simple webpage using the Next.js framework that allows users to
upload an invoice image.

● Implement feedback mechanisms on the webpage (e.g., progress indicator,
success/error messages). 

Backend:
● Create a backend service using the NestJS framework to handle image uploads, manage OCR processing, and store results in the database.

Authentication and Permissions:
● Users must be authenticated using GAuth prior to being able to upload the invoice. 
Only the user who uploaded the document can be able to access it. You can use any open-source authentication tool.

Deliverables:
● A system design document including architecture diagrams.

● Source code for the frontend and backend services.

● Instructions for setting up and running the solution, including any necessary AWS configuration
